👋 Hi, I’m @marcthird128. I do front-end web dev for fun :). Here's how it happened: Searching around a storage room, I found my mom's old Windows PC from 2013. She let me use it and one day I logged in when I realized
   that there was this weird desktop shortcut - it was titled "Go to Egypt" and had a reddish-brown icon that looked like a carpet. Curiously, I clicked on it. Chrome opened up and there it was - the tapestry of
   grace (a homeschool curriculum) homepage. I was weirded out - how did Chrome work if I didn't have internet?!? (What, I was new to web browsing - my mom made me work offline and I'd never touched chrome before.)

   I looked at the adress bar. `file://C:/Program Files (x86)/Go To Egypt/Tapestry Of Grace/index.htm`. .htm? I'd never seen _that_ extension before. But, a file extension is an oppurtunity, right? I had tried
   countless times to oepn up binary files, only to be dismayed by jibberish like `¯Kƒè#Scÿ 8Çòâ–'~Ÿ?òþ­Úû•è«P+ù.W—ù¿é¢½bŠþK§Uåþoúh¯EX¢€.` Poor programmers. They must of had it hard making `WINWORD.EXE`
   (That's what the MS Word executable is called.) How relieved I was when I finnally opened up a `.csv` for People and found out that it was readable. After saving something made with WordPad, I figured
   out that `.rtf`'s aren't too bad either.

   I had to know what `.htm`'s were like. So I opened File Explorer and navigated to `index.htm`. `Open with notepad`. Bingo! It was a readable format! I quickly began scrolling around and looking at the page.

       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
       <head>
         <title>Tapestry Of Grace | Year 1</title>
         <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="icon.ico">
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="config/reset.css">
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="config/style.css">
         <script src="config/js/ddaccordion.js">
         // Dynamic Drive Accordion
         // (c) Dynamic Drive
         </script>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div class="wrapper">
          . . .

   Wow, this is cool! Obviously stuff encased in `<` and `>` show the start of something and `</...>` means it's the end. Not too bad. Hey, there's the title of the page - encased in `<title>` things.
   And there's the path to the banner image - `img/banner.png`! Wow! this file format is great! you can do all this crazy stuff with it!

   Fast forward a year or so. I hat pretty much learned html and had made so many example pages that for any letter on the alphabet you typed in the adress bar it would have some result for `file://...`.
   Now, I was sick of plain old HTML and CSS. Yeah, it's kinda cool, but I knew that something was missing. The homeshcool page had this cool thing that when you clicked a button on the sidebar something
   opened up with a list of more buttons. When you clicked those buttons a page came up with a bunch of links. What was behind that all? I decided to look in the only place I hadn't gone yet - the mysterious
   `.js` files. One time I had opened one, and never again! It was filled with all kinds of strange expressions. Text like `()=>{r.f(); if(typeof e!="string")e.b(n-1)}` seemed meaningless. And even worse, it
   was filled with plain English! The code was littered with stuff like `// Check device type`. What's the point of a code language that you can just throw in english to be followed?! You can just say 
   "Make the button turn blue when hovered" and it works?!? Uggh.

   But I didn't really have a choice. I knew it was making the page responsive. So, I tried. It was hard though. You developers who casually write `res = [...d].toSorted(function(a,b){return d(a,b) != 0})`
   don't know how hard it is to figure it out from scratch. Try to finding out the meaning of "pe mbaꞌe iporãvéva Fraktur fuente rehegu" (unless you are an expert in Gurani). But, of course, with some reading
   at w3schools etc, and lots of mistakes like running broken code with a Java interpreter, I finally made a video game.

   Now, I just keep learning more code languages. It's fun to keep going more and more low-level until you're just writing EXE's from scratch in a hex editor. But yeah, I just do it in spare time as a hobby.

   Oh, also, if you read this all, you are as crazy as me :)

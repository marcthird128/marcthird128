**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcthird128**

I am a self-taught developer and I mostly do the HTML/CSS/JS thing but I am also decent at C++ and I am learning Java.
I have had a LOT of experience making basic video games and random example websites for like 5 years, I have this old PC loaded with them.
maybe I'll upload them later.

**What I'm learning**

   - Node.js
   - Java and JavaSwing
   - C/C++ and Windows SDK
   - CPU Architecture and Assembly

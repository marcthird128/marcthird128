**ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcthird128**

I am a self-taught developer and I mostly do the HTML/CSS/JS thing but I am also decent at C++ and I am learning Java.
I have had a LOT of practice making basic video games and random example websites, I have this old PC loaded with all them and
maybe I'll upload them later.

**What I'm learning**

   - Java and JavaSwing
   - C/C++ and Windows SDK
   - CPU Architecture and Assembly

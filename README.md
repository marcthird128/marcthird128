👋 Hi, I’m @marcthird128. I do front-edn web dev for fun :). Here's how it happened: Searching around a storage room, I found my mom's old Windows PC from 2013. She let me use it and one day I logged in when I realized
   that there was this weird desktop shortcut - it was titled "Go to Egypt" and had a reddish-brown icon that looked like a carpet. Curiously, I clicked on it. Chrome opened up and there it was - the tapestry of
   grace (a homeschool curriculum) homepage. I was weirded out - how did Chrome work if I didn't have internet?!? (What, I was new to web browsing - my mom made me work offline and I'd never touched chrome before.)

   I looked at the adress bar. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Go To Egypt\Tapestry Of Grace\index.htm` .htm? I'd never seen _that_ extension before. But, a file extension is an oppurtunity, right? I had tried
   countless times to oepn up binary files, only to be dismayed by jibberish like `¯Kƒè#S\`cÿ 8Çòâ–'~Ÿ?òþ­Úû•è«P+ù.W—ù¿é¢½bŠþK§Uåþoúh¯EX¢€.` Poor programmers. They must of had it hard making `WINWORD.EXE`
   (That's what the MS Word executable is called.) How relieved I was when I finnally opened up a `.csv` for People and found out that it was readable. After saving something made with WordPad, I figured
   out that `.rtf`'s aren't too bad either.

   I had to know what `.htm`'s were like. So I opened File Explorer and navigated to `index.htm`. `Open with notepad`. Bingo! It was a readable format! I quickly began scrolling around and looking at the page.

       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
       <head>
         <title>Tapestry Of Grace | Year 1</title>
         <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="icon.ico">

         // (c) Dynamic Drive
         </script>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div class="wrapper">
          . . .

   Wow, this is cool! Obviously stuff encased in `<` and `>` are show the start of something and `</...>` means it's the end. Not too bad. Hey, there's the title of the page - encased in `<title>` things.
